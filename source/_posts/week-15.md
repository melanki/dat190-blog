# The Writing phase #1

## Writing about our preliminary findings ✍️
This week was spent on writing an preliminary draft of our thesis.
The team decided to create & use a LaTeX template in order to automate formatting, keep an consistant look and making it easier to divide the thesis into smaller components.

We collaborated on writing the draft in Overleaf, which is basically a Google Docs for LaTeX files.

## Deliverables 📦
