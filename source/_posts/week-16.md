# The Discovery phase #4

## Presentation of preliminary draft üñºÔ∏è
This week was spent preparing for our presentation of our preliminary draft.

We created a PPT slide that we presented for the school.

## Putting meat to the bone üõ†Ô∏è
Our team used this week to write general logic for manipulating SVGs for the HTMLGFX Editor.

### General methods
A library to be hosted in the editor & the server. Can be summarized as RPC to be used by VizStory to edit SVG files hosted by HTMLGFX API. *(E.g. change color of text)*

VizStory needs this logic to know how to perform the actions described in the VDF model.

### Generate VDF model
A library to generate VDF model.

VizStory needs this logic to know what actions it can perform.

## Deliverables üì¶
None
