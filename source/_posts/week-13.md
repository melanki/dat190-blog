Getting up to speed with several new tools at once have been challenging to say.

Typescript made a lot of sense as we were familiar with Javascript & Java.

Vue was a bit worse, getting into the whole lifecycle & state mindset.

Storybook itself was pretty straight forward, but the combination of Storybook & Vue was what made it a hassle.

## First Proof of Concept üõ†Ô∏è
As we had a meeting with Vizrt coming up, we took all of our components and put it together to a View / Page.
We managed to put together a proof of concept, where we could import an SVG and render the graphics & look at the structure / tags of the imported SVG.

## Crash course in Academic Writing & Methods ‚úçÔ∏è
We also attended a lecture for writing academically & had a workshop on **metode?**

## Deliverables üì¶
None
